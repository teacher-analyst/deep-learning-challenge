# deep-learning-challenge
This project is part of Module 21 Challenge of the Monash University Data Analytics Bootcamp. 

## Project Description
### Problem
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

### Deliverables
1. Preprocess the data
2. Compile, train and evaluate the Neural Network model using Tensorflow
3. Optimise the model until a target prdictive accuracy of 75% or hight is achieved
4. Write a report on the Neural Network Model

### Technology 
- Tensorflow
- sklearn
- pandas
